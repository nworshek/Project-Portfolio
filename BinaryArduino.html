    <h1>Binary Arduino Project</h1>
    <p>This is my first real arduino project I am creating from scratch. The purpose of this project is to enhance
        my c++ and arduino skills. I want to have 2 buttons, one for 0 and another for 1. This will correspond to 
        binary digits. I will then have it be converted to the corresponding element in the ASCII table which 
        will then be printed onto an LCD screen. I may further add more buttons such as an enter button so that I can
        add multiple lines of binary strings so i can create words/sentences. I will also have to create another button
        that will be used for deletion of that data so I can create a fresh string. 
    </p>
